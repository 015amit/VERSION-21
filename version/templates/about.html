        Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs
        that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers instead
        of a single computer, and are outside the purview and control of a
        single authority.<br />A standard web app, such as Uber or Twitter, runs
        on a computer system which is owned and operated by an organization,
        giving it full authority over the app and its workings. There may be
        multiple users on one side, but the backend is controlled by a single
        organization.
